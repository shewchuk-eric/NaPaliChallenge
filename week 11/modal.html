    <p>Modals have many uses.  Probably one of the best uses is for compartmentalizing information to help establish and/or maintain an informational hierarchy.  In this case I will use it to display a nice photo I got during a week when winds were coming out of the south and bringing volcanic gasses up from Hawaii island.  The resulting sunrise and sunset colors were incredible!</p>
