        The Hawaiian island of Kauai is known as 'The Garden Island'.  Home to the wettest place on earth, Kauai boasts lush tropical vegetation and dozens of waterfalls.  It's also home to the Napali coast - some of the most beautiful coastline in the world.  The only way to see the Napali coast is by boat or helicopter and tens of thousands of visitors per year book sightseeing tours to do just that.  Each year, that incredible beauty becomes the course for one of the world's premier outrigger canoe races.  The Na Pali Challenge is a world-class endurance race that brings top paddling athletes to Kauai from far-flung locations.  It is an opportunity for wahine and kane to come together and race 37 miles down the stunning Na Pali Coast.

      <h3>Crews and Equipment</h3>
      <h4>Crews</h4>
      <p>
      Each team consists of 6 wahine(women) and 6 kane(men) who will take alternating turns of 30 minutes in the canoe. An escort boat is used to carry the team that is not currently paddling the canoe and will position the team for a crew change that must be completed during a three minute window. Each competitor will provide their own paddle and each 12 person team should provide a few spare paddles in case of damage or loss during the race. 
      </p>
      <p>There are three separate starts to the race.  The first start is youth teams where all competitors on a team are less than 18 years old.  Even though they're young, many of these teams are formed by experienced paddlers that will turn in shorter race times than many of the adults!  The second start will take place 30 minutes after the first and will consist of adults competing in Traditional class canoes.  The final start, which is held 30 minutes after the second start, will consist of adults competing in Unlimited class canoes.  Some of these teams are so fast that they will finish the race before that last of the youth teams, which started an hour earlier, have completed the race.
      </p>
      <h4>Canoes</h4>
      <p>There are two types of canoe that will be used in this race. The "Traditional" canoe is constructed of fiberglass and weighs approximately 400 pounds.  These have been the mainstay of the race for most of its history.  Increasingly popular is the "Unlimited" class canoe which is constructed of carbon fiber and epoxy resin.  These canoes weigh in at just under 250 pounds. They are a bit harder to steer but the reduced weight makes them faster on the water and takes less endurance to push them across the finish line.</p>
      <h4>Paddles</h4>
      <p>For many years, paddles were 100% wood construction. This year it's unlikely that you'll see a single paddle with a wood blade.  Although wood blades remain popular for the regatta (1/4 to 1 1/2 mile sprints) racing season, their extra weight is unwelcome on a race that requires as much endurance as the Napali Challenge.  So, what every paddler will be using is a carbon fiber blade attached to a single or double bend wooden shaft.  The difference between a single bend or double bend is a matter of personal preference.</p>

      <h3>The Course</h3>
      <p>
        The 37 mile course starts on the beach at Hanalei Bay on Kauai's north shore.  The mens team will start the race and paddle for the first 30 minutes before the womens crew takes over.  During the first round of paddling, most teams will make it out of the bay and travel as far as five miles to the west.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next few hours, the teams will alternate between resting and paddling in 30 minute increments.  Top teams typically maintain a pace of about 7 miles per hour when paddling a Traditional class canoe.  Speeds are closer to 9 miles per hour for top teams paddling Unlimited class canoes.  This means that most paddling teams will cross the finish line in 4-6 hours after the start.</p>
