    <h1>Aloha From Kauai</h1>
    <section class="light">
        <p>Hi everyone.  A decade ago I was working on a Web Development degree.  At the time, my wife and I were working on a long-term plan to move to Hawaii.  When the day to leave California finally arrived, I figured I'd take a semester or two off.  Ten years later, here I am in my second semester of picking up the pieces and re-learning a lot of stuff I mostly forgot from lack of use.</p>

        <p>My wife and I run a scuba tours company - <a href="https://www.gardenisledivers.com/">Garden Isle Divers</a> - and work together most days.  Diving is something I share with two of my four children.  That photo is of me and my youngest daughter about 40 feet deep at a local spot.</p>
